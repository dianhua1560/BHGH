Feature: udpate events on the events page
 
	As an event organizer
	So that I can accurately present upcoming events
	I want to be able to update and delete existing events on the events page

Background: events have been added to the database

	Given the following events exist:
	| title | description | time |
	| title1 | description1 | 1-May-2016 |
	| title2 | description2 | 2-May-2016 |
	| title3 | description3 | 3-May-2016 |
	| title4 | description4 | 4-May-2015 |
	| title5 | description5 | 5-May-2015 |

	Given the following members exist:
	| name | email | position |
	| David | davidbliu@gmail.com | admin | 
	| Alice | alice@gmail.com | tutor | 
	| Bob | bob@gmail.com | user |

	Given the following event photos exist
	| title | url |
	| title1 | url1 | 
	| title2 | url2 |

	When I delete "title1"
	Then I should not see "title1"

	Then I should be on the events page
	And I should see "new description"
